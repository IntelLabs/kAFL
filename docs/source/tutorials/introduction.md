# Introduction

This tutorial will introduce you to the [kAFL](https://github.com/IntelLabs/kAFL) fuzzer, from the installation process to fuzzing a real target.

Throughout this tutorial, we will$
1. install kAFL on your local machine
2. fuzz a real linux kernel using the kAFL agent
3. analyze the results.

At the end of the tutorial you should have been able to find a few bugs, understand their root cause, have a better understanding of the overall kAFL setup and user interface, and be able to adapt kAFL to your targets using our reference documentation and how-to guides.
