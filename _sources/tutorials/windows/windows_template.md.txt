# Windows VM Template

In order to execute the targets, we need a Windows VM to play with and configured to compile and load a driver.

Fortunately, we already provide this template and the necessary tooling under [`templates/windows`](https://github.com/IntelLabs/kafl.targets/tree/master/templates/windows).

Our Windows template is based on a [`Windows 10 Enterprise x64`](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-10-enterprise) image with `22H2` feature updates.

The following software is installed:

- MSVC compiler
- latest [SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/) and [WDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk)
- WDK integration in Visual Studio
- Test mode enabled (load testsigned drivers)

:::{Note}
The template is simply a recipe to build Windows 10 and setup the software components mentionned above.

As a user, you are not receiving any license to any third-party software from Intel through this.

## Setup the tooling

The following tooling is required to build and use the VM in our tutorial:

- [Packer](https://www.packer.io/): an image build automation tool that will be used to create the initial qcow2
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/): a simplified development environment to manage our VM and improve our workflow to edit the our harness sources, upload them and configure them to be triggered when Windows boot
- [Vagrant plugins](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/wiki/Available-Vagrant-Plugins): A set of plugins extended the possiblities of vagrant. We will mainly use the [`vagrant-libvirt`](https://github.com/vagrant-libvirt/vagrant-libvirt) provider to import our VM under libvirt's `qemu:///session` connection.
- [Ansible and WinRM](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/os_guide/windows_winrm.html): Ansible will be used in conjonction with the Windows builtin `WinRM` node management protocol to provision the VM

The initial kAFL Ansible playbook that you have already used during the [installation](../installation.md#3-deploying-kafl--make-deploy) phase can be reused to install those tools !

We only need to specify some extra tags this time:

~~~shell
make deploy -- --tags examples,examples-template-windows
~~~

To verify your installation:

~~~shell
$ packer version
Packer v1.9.1 # or above
$ vagrant version
Installed Version: 2.3.6 # pinned 2.3.6
Latest Version: 2.3.7
...
$ vagrant plugin list
vagrant-host-shell (0.0.4, global) # or above
vagrant-libvirt (0.12.2, global) # or above
~~~

## Build the Windows VM Template

Now we can continue with building the actual image !

Let's move to the windows image template directory, and run the build:
~~~shell
cd kAFL/kafl/examples/templates/windows
make build
~~~

:::{Note}
Default values for allocated ressources to build the VM:
- `4` cpus
- `4G` of RAM

You can modify these values either in `win10.pkrvars.hcl`, or by updating the Packer command line in the `Makefile` `build` target:

~~~shell
packer build -var-file win10.pkrvars.hcl -var cpus=8 -var memory=8192 windows.pkr.hcl
~~~
::::{Note}
If for any reason you wish to opt-out of the automated provisioning step and want to setup the software components yourself (licensing issues, legal, etc),
you can remove the `provisioner "ansible"` section from the main `windows.pkr.hcl` template file.
::::
:::

You should get the following output:
~~~shell
source /home/user/kafl/kafl/examples/templates/windows/../../venv/bin/activate && packer build -var-file win10.pkrvars.hcl windows.pkr.hcl
qemu.windows: output will be in this color.

Building the image and generating the build artifacts should take `~1h` to complete.

:::{warning}
If for any reason the build fails:

~~~python
==> qemu.windows: Error launching VM: Qemu failed to start. Please run with PACKER_LOG=1 to get more info.
~~~
You can set the environment variable `PACKER_LOG` to get more verbose output:

~~~shell
PACKER_LOG=1 make build
~~~

## Import the template into Vagrant

Then, we will import the generated build artifact `packer_windows_libvirt.box` as a Box available for Vagrant.

Again, use the Makefile:

~~~shell
make import
~~~

Expected output
~~~shell
vagrant box remove kafl_windows || true
Box 'kafl_windows' (v0) with provider 'libvirt' appears
to still be in use by at least one Vagrant environment. Removing
the box could corrupt the environment. We recommend destroying
these environments first:

vagrant-kafl-windows (ID: aa61f0e482954cec9b853f9b8837a088)

Are you sure you want to remove this box? [y/N] y
Removing box 'kafl_windows' (v0) with provider 'libvirt'...
Vagrant-libvirt plugin removed box only from /home/user/.vagrant.d/boxes directory
From Libvirt storage pool you have to delete image manually(virsh, virt-manager or by any other tool)
vagrant box add packer_windows_libvirt.box --name kafl_windows
==> box: Box file was not detected as metadata. Adding it directly...
==> box: Adding box 'kafl_windows' (v0) for provider:
    box: Unpacking necessary files from: file:///home/user/kafl/kafl/examples/templates/windows/packer_windows_libvirt.box
==> box: Successfully added box 'kafl_windows' (v0) for 'libvirt'!
~~~

We can confirm that the box has been imported:
~~~shell
$ vagrant box list
kafl_windows (libvirt, 0)
~~~

## Import into libvirt

Finally, the last step of this section will be have a VM defined in libvirt's `qemu:///session` connection, and take a snapshot when WinRM is available,
so we can restore that snapshot and provision it right away !

Let's go to the `examples/windows-x86_64` folder and run `make init`
~~~shell
cd ../../windows_x86_64
make init
~~~

Expected output:
~~~shell
make[1]: Entering directory '/home/user/kafl/kafl/examples/windows_x86_64'
vagrant up --no-provision

Congratulations ! 🎉

You are now ready to setup our Windows targets and almost there to start fuzzing ! ⚡
