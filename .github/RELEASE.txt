This release marks the adoption of [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) as a new deployment/installation tool for kAFL.

It brings multiple benefits, such as:
- more reliability and readability in the installation process
- automated remote deployment on multiple servers
- modularization and reuse with kAFL managed as an [Ansible collection](https://github.com/IntelLabs/kAFL/tree/master/deploy/intellabs/kafl)
- [deployment CI checks](https://github.com/IntelLabs/kAFL/actions/workflows/CI.yml) on Github Actions to ensure a stable `master`
